This is a repository of all the Pyhton assignments given in the [*Python for Everybody Specialisation held on Coursear taught by Charles Russell Severance*](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). Below are a list of the projects and an explanation of their purpose.

## 1. [Salary Calculator](https://github.com/DataBaby20/Python-assignments/blob/master/salary.py):
This program calculates the total weekly pay of its user by multiplying the fixed hourly wage rate by the number of hours worked. In the even that the user works more than the usual 40 hours, the code computes an increased wage rate of 1.5 times the normal wage rate and thus leads to a higher compensation for any overtime work done.

Total_weekly_pay = total_hours_worked(less than or exactly 40 hours) * wage_rate
In the event of overtime: Total_weekly_pay = ((total_hours_worked - 40)* 1.5*wage_rate) + (40 * wage_rate)

The above is a basic explanation of the code's purpose. Additionally, it throws a custom error using the "try-except" conditionals if the input from the user is a non-integer and it also throws an error if the input is a negative value. The program was written to solidify my knowledge on functions, variables and conditionals.

## 2. [Loops](https://github.com/DataBaby20/Python-assignments/blob/master/number_accumulator.py):
This program in this section repeatedly takes in a users input until the user specifies that they are done providing input by typing in "done." Once the input has been received, the programme calculates the sum, average and count of all numbers received and returns the values. This exercise helps solidify fundamental knowledge in "while loops."

## 3. [Strings]():
This program is given a hardcoded string and extracts the characters after the colon (:) then transforms those characters to floats. This exercise helps solidify basic knowledge in using strings and string manipulation.

## 4. [File operations]():
This programs/exercise in this section performs basic file and string operations such as opening, reading, capitalising, searching, and slicing. It also utlises a for loop and a "try-except" block. This section contains 2 exercises which are suffeciently described using comments in the code.The text files used in this section can be found in the same folder as the code itself.

## 5. [Lists]():
The exercises in this section on lists helped solidify basic knowledge on lists. It covered list manipulation such as slicing and indexing; it also explains the relationship between strings and lists. The text files used in this section can be found in the same folder as the code itself.This section contains 2 exercises which are suffeciently described using comments in the code.
